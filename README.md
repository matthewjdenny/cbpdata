# cbpdata
This package is designed to facilitate Congressional bills bulk data collection. It will eventually serve as the back end for the congressional bills project data, which we hope to bring up to a monthly update cadence.

**PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS OR ERRORS TO <matthewjdenny@gmail.com>**. 

### Installing The Package

 If you want the most current development version of the package (available here), you will need to start by making sure you have Hadley Wickham's devtools package installed.

    install.packages("devtools")
    
Now we can install from Github using the following line:

    devtools::install_github("matthewjdenny/cbpdata")

Once the `cbpdata` package is installed, you may access its functionality as you would any other package by calling:

    library(cbpdata)
